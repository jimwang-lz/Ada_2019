# Food Safety in Chicago Milestone II

## Summary of Research Questions in Milestone I

1. The overall sanitary conditions are discussed in different aspects. A new dataset of districts of Chicago is introduced to study the distribution of facilities and inspection results. Each violation type and facility type are investigated. The change of inspection results and risks over time is also presented. In addition, p-value analysis is used to study the clustering phenomenon of results and risks in time domain.

   There are two questions that need further investigation: (1) The geographical clustering phenomenon of results and risks of facilities. (2) How does food hygiene conditions correlate to risks and results? To what extent do high risks and 'Fail's indicate poor sanitation?
    
    
2. Different kinds of inspections have similar distributions over time but have different distributions of results, and advanced-noticed inspections and re-inspections do have a better passrate. 

   What is still puzzling is the state's requirement of food and how to predict the risks of facilities.


## Plan for futher analysis and report

(1) Study the geographical clustering if possible.

(2) Construct a model to predict the risks and results of a facility.

(3) Find extra datasets to enrich the data and try to find more geographical correlations

(4) Select a few interesting results to study in depth.

(5) Embellish the graphs.

(6) Integrate the previous conclusions and try to form a storyline.
