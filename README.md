## Abstract
*What's the motivation behind your project? A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why?*

If you ask some elderlies, they may say a little dirt never killed anybody. However, with the degradation of the environment recently, food safety, especially when eating outside, has become a more and more serious issue all around the world. Therefore, inspections are performed by the staff from the Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program using a standardized procedure.  According to the data displayed on the Kaggle, we get the result with different performances of establishments. Our objects are to review the overall sanitary conditions using the inspection results and analyze the effectiveness of the inspection methods in order to evaluate the reliability of the overall results. Possibly, we could understand the food hygiene condition all over the world through this small state. 
 
## Research Questions

*A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.*

1. The sanitary conditions of food establishments:
- How is the overall sanitary condition of Chicago’s dining establishments? How is it distributed in this city?
- What are the most common violations?
- How does food hygiene condition correlate to facility type: Does a certain type of restaurant have a more serious problem on food security?
- How does food hygiene condition correlate to time (i.e. months, seasons, and years): Does hot weather mean bad food sanitation? Does food safety get improved over time?

 
2. The effectiveness of the inspection methods:
- Is different inspections’ frequency consistent: Do different kinds of inspections have similar distribution both in the time domain and geographic domain?
- How does inspection’s result correlate to the inspection’s type and frequency: for example, do advanced noticed inspection have a better result?
- Does the inspection frequency satisfy the state’s requirements?
- How do different inspection methods influence the inspection results?
3. Case study:
Analyze the situation of some most popular food establishments and give some suggestions to nowadays young people in restaurant selection.
 
## Dataset
*List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.*
We will use the dataset from the City of Chicago Open Data which is derived from inspections of restaurants and other food establishments in Chicago from January 1st, 2010 to the present. This dataset includes abundant information on the inspections’ results. However, to achieve our goal, we may extend our data with the population demographics and the district’s division from the official website of Chicago.<br>

## Conclusion

The data story contains the contention of our project. We mainly show the most representatives in our story, including descriptive statistics in inspections, inspection effectiveness evaluation and some basic analysis of violations. Several proofs have been verified to make the conclusion that inspections are effective in general. Despite that, the inspection frequency corresponding to the specific "risk" type did reach designed frequency. For example, "risk 1(high)" does have a higher pass-rate compared to others with a higher inspection frequency. As for the new violation code, although it's hard to use it to infer the severity, we can somehow verify the effectiveness of the changing violation category.
